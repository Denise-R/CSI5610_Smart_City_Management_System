Part 6: Emergency Services Management (01 Matrix)
"""
"""
If we think of the city as a grid, where the emergency services are located in cells with value  0 and the other cells are 1. 
The algorithm would find the ETA of the emergency services. Example, if something happens at cell x and  if the shortest distance
is 3 from the nearest 0/emergency service, then the ETA would be letâ€™s say 3 min.
